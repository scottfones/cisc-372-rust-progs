Today everyone should commit to their own personal repository.  Create
a subdirectory of breakout named "03".  Add 03 to version control.

Work with a partner on these problems.  Do as many as you can.

             THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS

These questions do not require you to write any code, just to
understand.  However you may want to write some code to experiment if
you aren't sure about something.

Write the answers to the following questions in a plain text file
named "types.txt" (in 03):

1. Write the English name of the type of x:

(a) int *x[];
(b) unsigned long (*x[])[n];

2. Declare x to be a pointer to an array of doubles:


3. Consider the following code snippet:

void f(int a[1000]) {
  ...
}
int b[1000];
int main() {
  ...
  f(b);
  ...
}

How many bytes of data are copied from b to a in the
call f(b)?  Your answer should be a C expression.

[To be clear: we are just asking about the interval
that begins with the call to f and ends just after
a is initialized, before the body of f is executed.]
