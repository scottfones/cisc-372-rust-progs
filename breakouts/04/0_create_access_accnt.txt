Everyone needs an ACCESS account to access the Bridges-2
supercomputer.  Go to 

https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user

and create an account. You should be able to "register with an
existing identity" by using your UD credentials, typing and selecting
"University of Delaware" from the long dropdown menu.

Put your ACCESS user name in a plain text file named ACCESS and commit
this file in the root of your personal Subversion repository. Nothing
else goes in the file except your ACCESS user name.
